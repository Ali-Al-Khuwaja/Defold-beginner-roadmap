  <h2>Welcome to Defold</h2>
  <p>If you're new to programming and game development, I recommend starting with the official Defold <a
      href="https://defold.com/tutorials/">tutorials</a> after at least finishing reading the four core concepts of
    Defold. These tutorials will give you a sense of self-development and help you get started with the basics, at least
    that's what I felt.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>note: it's important that you realize the existence of these resources while doing the tutorials so you know
      where you should search .</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here's a roadmap for learning Defold, made for beginners:</p>
  <p><strong>Phase 1: Foundations</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Install Defold:</strong> Download and install the Defold editor from the official website <a
        href="https://defold.com/download/">here</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Editor Basics:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/editor/">editor interface</a>: project
          view, scene editor, properties panel, console, it's very minimal and easy to understand.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Learn the four core concepts of Defold:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn about <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/building-blocks/">the building blocks of Defold</a>, game
          objects, components and collections.</li>
        <li>Learn about <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/addressing/">Addressing</a>, Code that controls a running
          game must be able to reach every object and component to manipulate what the player sees and hears, and
          Defoldâ€™s addressing mechanism makes this possible.</li>
        <li>Learn about Message passing, message passing is a mechanism for Defold game objects to communicate with each
          other.</li>
        <li>Learn about <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/application-lifecycle/">application lifecycle</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Explore the Defold Manual:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>skim over the Defold <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/introduction/">manuals</a> to get a better
          understanding of the engine and its features.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Phase 2: Scripting and Game Logic</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lua Scripting Basics:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn the <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/lua/">basics of Lua syntax</a>: variables, data types,
          operators, control flow (if statements, loops), functions, there you will be given all the resources you will
          ever need to learn Lua.</li>
        <li>Understand how to attach <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/script/">scripts</a> to game objects and use
          the <code>init()</code>, <code>update()</code>, and <code>on_message()</code> functions.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Basic Game Mechanics:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement movement using <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/input-key-and-text/">keyboard</a> or <a
            href="https://defold.com/manuals/input-mouse-and-touch/">mouse input</a>.</li>
        <li>Create simple <a href="https://defold.com/examples/physics/dynamic/">collision detection</a> between game
          objects.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Example Projects:</strong> Start with very simple game ideas:
      <ul>
        <li>&quot;Hello World&quot; with interactive elements (e.g., a button that changes color when clicked).</li>
        <li>A simple &quot;dodge the falling objects&quot; game or just do a tutorial like snake.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Phase 3: Intermediate Concepts</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Collections and Factories:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn how to use collections to organize your game objects.</li>
        <li>Understand how to use <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/collection-factory/">factories</a> to create
          instances of game objects at runtime.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Animation:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn how to create and use sprite <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/animation/">animations</a>.</li>
        <li>Implement animation based on game events (e.g., walking animation when moving).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>User Interface (UI):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn how to create and manage <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/gui/">UI elements</a> (buttons, text,
          images).</li>
        <li>Implement basic UI interactions.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Sound and Music:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn how to <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/sound/">add sound effects</a> and background music to your
          game.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>More Complex Projects:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>A simple platformer with basic movement, jumping, and collision, there is an example game already made if
          you need.</li>
        <li>A top-down shooter with basic enemy AI.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Phase 4: Advanced Topics and Polish (Ongoing)</strong></p>
  <ul>

      for more realistic movement and interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Scripting:</strong> Learn more advanced Lua techniques, such as object-oriented programming.
    </li>

      effects.</li>
    <li><strong>Networking:</strong> If you're interested in multiplayer games, learn <a
        href="https://defold.com/manuals/networking/">about networking </a>concepts and Defold's networking
      capabilities.</li>

    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Don't try to create a complex game right away. Start with small, manageable
      projects and gradually increase the complexity.</li>
    <li><strong>Focus on understanding the fundamentals:</strong> Make sure you have a solid understanding of the basic
      concepts before moving on to more advanced topics.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't be afraid to ask for help:</strong> The community forum is very helpful and welcoming to
      beginners, also check the discord server.</li>
    <li><strong>Official examples:</strong> Work through the <a href="https://defold.com/examples/">examples</a>, These
      are a great starting point and cover the basics effectively.</li>
