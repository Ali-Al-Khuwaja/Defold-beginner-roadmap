<p>more info <a href="https://defold.com/product/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Who is this <s>book</s> road-map for ?</h3>
<p>This <s>book</s>road-map is for complete beginners who may have no programming or game development experience and want to learn Defold.</p>
<h3>How to use this <s>book</s> road-map ?</h3>
<p>The <s>book</s> road-map has chapters that build on each other,we will make some mini-projects and finish it with a final game.</p>
<p>The <s>book</s> road-map is written by a single person who is also learning just like you and the primary goal is to achieve the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first, and then focus on refining it, so throughout the whole <s>book</s> road-map you will be given links to some lesson to read because it's already exits.</p>
<h3>Setting up your workspace:</h3>
<p>let's start setting up your workspace, first you should <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/install/">install Defold</a> if you haven't done it already, then read this introduction to <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/editor/">Defolds editor</a>.</p>
