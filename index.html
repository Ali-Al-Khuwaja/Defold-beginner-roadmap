<h2>Welcome to Defold</h2>
<p>If you're new to programming and game development, I recommend starting with the official Defold <a href="https://defold.com/tutorials/">tutorials</a>. These tutorials will give you a sense of self-development and help you get started with the basics, at least that's what I felt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>note: it's important that you realize the existence of these resources while doing the tutorials so you know where you should search .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a roadmap for learning Defold, made for beginners:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Foundations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Install Defold:</strong> Download and install the Defold editor from the official website <a href="https://defold.com/download/">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Editor Basics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/editor/">editor interface</a>: project view, scene editor, properties panel, console, it's very minimal and easy to understand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Understand Game Objects and Components:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Learn about <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/building-blocks/">the building blocks of Defold</a>, game objects, components and collections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Explore the Defold Manual:</strong>
<ul>
<li>skim over the Defold <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/introduction/">manuals</a> to get a better understanding of the engine and its features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 2: Scripting and Game Logic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lua Scripting Basics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Learn the <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/lua/">basics of Lua syntax</a>: variables, data types, operators, control flow (if statements, loops), functions, there you will be given all the resources you will ever need to learn Lua.</li>
<li>Understand how to attach <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/script/">scripts</a> to game objects and use the <code>init()</code>, <code>update()</code>, and <code>on_message()</code> functions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Basic Game Mechanics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Implement movement using <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/input-key-and-text/">keyboard</a> or <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/input-mouse-and-touch/">mouse input</a>.</li>
<li>Create simple <a href="https://defold.com/examples/physics/dynamic/">collision detection</a> between game objects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example Projects:</strong> Start with very simple game ideas:
<ul>
<li>&quot;Hello World&quot; with interactive elements (e.g., a button that changes color when clicked).</li>
<li>A simple &quot;dodge the falling objects&quot; game or just do a tutorial like snake.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 3: Intermediate Concepts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collections and Factories:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to use collections to organize your game objects.</li>
<li>Understand how to use <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/collection-factory/">factories</a> to create instances of game objects at runtime.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Animation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to create and use sprite <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/animation/">animations</a>.</li>
<li>Implement animation based on game events (e.g., walking animation when moving).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>User Interface (UI):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to create and manage <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/gui/">UI elements</a> (buttons, text, images).</li>
<li>Implement basic UI interactions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sound and Music:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/sound/">add sound effects</a> and background music to your game.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>More Complex Projects:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A simple platformer with basic movement, jumping, and collision, there is an example game already made if you need.</li>
<li>A top-down shooter with basic enemy AI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 4: Advanced Topics and Polish (Ongoing)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physics:</strong> Dive deeper into the <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/physics/">physics</a> engine for more realistic movement and interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Scripting:</strong> Learn more advanced Lua techniques, such as object-oriented programming.</li>
<li><strong>Shaders:</strong> <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/shader/">Explore shaders</a> to create visual effects.</li>
<li><strong>Networking:</strong> If you're interested in multiplayer games, learn <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/networking/">about networking </a>concepts and Defold's networking capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Learn how to <a href="https://defold.com/manuals/optimization/">optimize your game</a> for performance.</li>
<li><strong>Publishing:</strong> Learn how to build and publish your game to different platforms, it's all in the manual.</li>
<li><strong>Community and Resources:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Engage with the Defold community on the forum and Discord.</li>
<li>Explore community-created extensions and libraries.</li>
<li>Continue learning through tutorials, documentation, and example projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start small:</strong> Don't try to create a complex game right away. Start with small, manageable projects and gradually increase the complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on understanding the fundamentals:</strong> Make sure you have a solid understanding of the basic concepts before moving on to more advanced topics.</li>
<li><strong>Don't be afraid to ask for help:</strong> The community forum is very helpful and welcoming to beginners, also check the discord server.</li>
<li><strong>Official examples:</strong> Work through the <a href="https://defold.com/examples/">examples</a>, These are a great starting point and cover the basics effectively.</li>
</ul>
