## Welcome to Defold

If you're new to programming and game development, I recommend starting with the official Defold [tutorials](https://defold.com/tutorials/). This will give you a sense of self-development and help you get started with the basics.

Here's a roadmap for learning Defold, tailored for beginners:

**Phase 1: Foundations**

- **Install Defold:** Download and install the Defold editor from the official website [here](https://defold.com/download/).
- **Editor Basics:**
  - Familiarize yourself with the [editor interface](https://defold.com/manuals/editor/): project view, scene editor, properties panel, console.
- **Understand Game Objects and Components:**
  - Learn about [game objects, components](https://defold.com/manuals/building-blocks/) (sprites, collision objects, scripts, etc.), and collections.
  - Understand the concept of parent-child relationships between game objects.
- **Explore the Defold Manual:**
  - Read through the Defold [manual](https://defold.com/manuals/) to get a better understanding of the engine and its features.

**Phase 2: Scripting and Game Logic**

- **Lua Scripting Basics:**
  - Learn the [basics of Lua syntax](https://defold.com/manuals/lua/): variables, data types, operators, control flow (if statements, loops), functions.
  - Understand how to attach [scripts](https://defold.com/manuals/script/) to game objects and use the `init()`, `update()`, and `on_message()` functions.
- **Basic Game Mechanics:**
  - Implement movement using [keyboard](https://defold.com/manuals/input-key-and-text/) or [mouse input](https://defold.com/manuals/input-mouse-and-touch/).
  - Create simple [collision detection](https://defold.com/examples/physics/dynamic/) between game objects.
- **Example Projects:** Start with very simple game ideas:
  - "Hello World" with interactive elements (e.g., a button that changes color when clicked).
  - A simple "dodge the falling objects" game.

**Phase 3: Intermediate Concepts**

- **Collections and Factories:**
  - Learn how to use collections to organize your game objects.
  - Understand how to use [factories](https://defold.com/manuals/collection-factory/) to create instances of game objects at runtime.
- **Animation:**
  - Learn how to create and use sprite [animations](https://defold.com/manuals/animation/).
  - Implement animation based on game events (e.g., walking animation when moving).
- **User Interface (UI):**
  - Learn how to create and manage [UI elements](https://defold.com/manuals/gui/) (buttons, text, images).
  - Implement basic UI interactions.
- **Sound and Music:**
  - Learn how to [add sound effects](https://defold.com/manuals/sound/) and background music to your game.
- **More Complex Projects:**
  - A simple platformer with basic movement, jumping, and collision.
  - A top-down shooter with basic enemy AI.

**Phase 4: Advanced Topics and Polish (Ongoing)**

- **Physics:** Dive deeper into the [physics](https://defold.com/manuals/physics/) engine for more realistic movement and interactions.
- **Advanced Scripting:** Learn more advanced Lua techniques, such as object-oriented programming.
- **Shaders:** [Explore shaders](https://defold.com/manuals/shader/) to create visual effects.
- **Networking:** If you're interested in multiplayer games, learn [about networking ](https://defold.com/manuals/networking/)concepts and Defold's networking capabilities.
- **Optimization:** Learn how to [optimize your game](https://defold.com/manuals/optimization/) for performance.
- **Publishing:** Learn how to build and publish your game to different platforms.
- **Community and Resources:**
  - Engage with the Defold community on the forum and Discord.
  - Explore community-created extensions and libraries.
  - Continue learning through tutorials, documentation, and example projects.

**Key Tips for Learning Defold:**

- **Start small:** Don't try to create a complex game right away. Start with small, manageable projects and gradually increase the complexity.
- **Focus on understanding the fundamentals:** Make sure you have a solid understanding of the basic concepts before moving on to more advanced topics.
- **Don't be afraid to ask for help:** The Defold community is very helpful and welcoming to beginners.
- **Official examples:** Work through the [examples](https://defold.com/examples/), These are a great starting point and cover the basics effectively.
